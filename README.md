The Problem

    Students apply for hundreds of jobs but can become disorganized.

    Input a company. Date of application.

    Add stages e.g. Stage 1: Phone screening. Stage 2: In-person interview.

    Status of application.

    Notes about each company. Maybe it can pull info from somewhere.
